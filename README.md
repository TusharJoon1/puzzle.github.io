## Puzzle 1(Basic)
In this puzzle, you must first perform some basic calculations. The sum of the product of the second maximum and minimum numbers in the given matrix is 189. After correctly submitting your answer, you will automatically be taken to the next question. The answer to that question is related to the previous question, as you can see in the matrix. The numbers 7, 8, and 9 are adjacent, and your answer does not contain  7. Therefore, you must write the corresponding word to seven, which is "pqrs".

* You will be given multiple chances to give the correct answer, otherwise you will not be able to proceed further. Alternatively, you have a time limit of 30 minutes to solve the puzzle.

## Puzzle 2(Mice problem)
